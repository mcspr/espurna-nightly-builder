### Nightly build?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_build
> In software development, a neutral build is a software build that reflects the current state of the source code checked into the source code version control system by the developers, and done in a neutral environment (an environment not used for development).  

> A nightly build is a neutral build that takes place automatically. These typically take place when no one is likely to be working in the office so that there are no changes to the source code during the build. The results of the build are inspected by the arriving programmers, who generally place a priority on ensuring the recent changes to the source code have not broken the build process or functionality of the software. Nightly builds also ensure that the build tools have not broken due to system updates, and are therefore often run whether any source code has changed or not.

### Where are .bin files?
